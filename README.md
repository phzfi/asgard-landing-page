# Asgard Landing Page
This README file is only for the eyes of Thor and Loki. **Do not show this to Odin or Borr.**

## Task
Your task as Thor and Loki is rather easy. **Listen to Odin, do what he says and only what he says.**

He's your father after all.

## Rules
0. Thor as the better coder helps Loki to code the greatest and latest of the coolest of the techs. Also known as a website. **Thor never touches the keyboard and/or mouse.**
1. **Do not ever add any external stylings to the page.** We don't want to fiddle with humane troubles. We are Gods... Gods.
2. **Do not ever add any external javascript to the page.** We don't want to see jQuery. We are Gods.
3. **Do not touch main.css**, our Asgardian' gatekeeper took a vacation and spent it on creating our initial style for our website. Don't touch this or you won't be visiting anywhere ever again.
4. **Never look behind you**, you want to focus on the task at hand.
5. Gods **don't** have a need to **cheat**.

## Information about Odin and Borr
**Borr should be standing behind you. Odin is in front of you.** Borr speaks only to Odin in ways that you can't understand.

Borr knows what he wants from the landing page. Odin tries to get this done. This is a war of websites, internet is everywhere... Even at Asgard (1Gbps / 5G)
